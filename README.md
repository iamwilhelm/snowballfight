= Snowball fight

A demo for a game written in Lua Love2D.

== Inspiration

I had always liked the dodgeball games, and thought that a similar game based 
on throwing snowballs would be fun. It's still a work in progress

== Next steps

- Get the timing down to throw super snowballs
- Figure out a non-annoying way to make snowballs. Crouch to make--but do you 
make them ahead of time and store them? Or do you pick up caches? Or both?
- Load maps generated by tiled.

== To run

You'll need a copy of love for now.
